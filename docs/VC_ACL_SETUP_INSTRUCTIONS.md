# Volunteer Consultant (VC) ACL Setup Instructions - Manual Configuration

This document provides step-by-step manual instructions for configuring CiviCRM ACL permissions to allow WordPress Subscribers (Volunteer Consultants) to view specific contacts and cases.

## Overview

WordPress Subscribers will be able to view:
1. **All contacts** with Service Requests in "Sent for Assignment" status
2. **All contacts** where the VC is assigned as "Case Coordinator" on any case (Service Request or Project)

Access is **contact-based**, meaning VCs will see ALL data for permitted contacts (cases, activities, relationships, contributions, etc.).

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, verify these items exist in your CiviCRM:
- ✅ Case Type: "Service Request" (name: `service_request`)
- ✅ Case Type: "Project" (name: `project`)
- ✅ Case Status: "Sent for Assignment"
- ✅ Relationship Type: "Case Coordinator is / Case Coordinator"
- ✅ ACL Role: "Volunteer Consultant" (should already exist)

---

## Part 3: Verify ACL Role Exists

The "Volunteer Consultant" ACL role should already exist from your previous setup.

1. Go to: **CiviCRM → Administer → Users and Permissions → Manage ACL Roles**

2. **Verify** you see: "Volunteer Consultant"

3. Click **Edit** next to "Volunteer Consultant"

4. **Record the Value** (e.g., `3`)
   - ACL Role Value: ________ (write this down!)

**If the role doesn't exist:**
1. Click **Add ACL Role**
2. **Label:** "Volunteer Consultant"
3. **Value:** (auto-generated, note it down)
4. **Description:** "Volunteer Consultants who can view assigned cases"
5. **Is Active:** Yes
6. Click **Save**

---

## Part 4: Assign ACL Role to ACL Group

This connects the "Volunteer Consultant" role to the group containing VC contacts.

1. Go to: **CiviCRM → Administer → Users and Permissions → Assign Users to ACL Roles**

2. Click **Add ACL Role Assignment**

3. **Configure Assignment:**
   - **ACL Role:** Select "Volunteer Consultant"
   - **Assigned to:** Select "Volunteer Consultants (ACL Group)" (the group you created in Part 2)
   - **Is Active:** Yes

4. Click **Save**

---

## Part 5: Create ACL Rules

These rules define what contacts VCs can view.

### Rule 1: VC View Clients with Service Requests Sent for Assignment

1. Go to: **CiviCRM → Administer → Users and Permissions → Manage ACLs**

2. Click **Add ACL**

3. **Configure ACL:**
   - **Description:** "VC View Clients with Service Requests Sent for Assignment"
   - **Role:** Select "Volunteer Consultant"
   - **Operation:** View
   - **Type of Data:** A group of contacts
   - **Which group:** Select "Clients - Open Service Requests (Sent for Assignment)" (from Part 1.1)
   - **Is Active:** Yes
   - **Priority:** 10

5. **Record the ACL ID**
   - ACL Rule 2 ID: ________

---

## Part 6: Verify Custom Hook (Already Implemented)

The Smart Group "Clients Assigned to Current VC" uses a custom hook to filter by the logged-in user. This hook is already implemented in the mascode extension and automatically looks up the group by name, so it works in both dev and production without any configuration needed.

**What it does:**
- When a VC accesses CiviCRM, the hook dynamically filters the "Clients Assigned to Current VC" group
- Only shows contacts where the current user is assigned as "Case Coordinator"
- Uses the group name "Clients_Assigned_to_Current_VC" to find the correct group ID automatically

**Location:** `/path/to/civicrm/ext/mascode/mascode.php` (function `mascode_civicrm_aclGroup`)

**No configuration needed** - the hook will automatically work once you create the smart group with the correct name in Part 1.2.

---

## Part 7: Add VC Contacts to ACL Group

Volunteer Consultants must be added to the "Volunteer Consultants (ACL Group)" to receive permissions.

### Option A: Manual Addition

1. Go to: **CiviCRM → Contacts → Manage Groups**

2. Find: "Volunteer Consultants (ACL Group)"

3. Click **Settings** → **Group Members**

4. Click **Add Members to Group**

---

## Part 8: Configure WordPress Permissions

### Step 8.1: Grant CiviCRM Permissions to Subscriber Role

1. Go to: **WordPress Admin → CiviCRM → Administer → Users and Permissions → Permissions (WordPress)**

2. Find the **Subscriber** column

3. **Check these permissions:**
   - ✅ `access CiviCRM`
   - ✅ `access all cases and activities`
   - ✅ `view all contacts`

4. **Optional permissions** (add if VCs need to take actions):
   - `add contacts` - If VCs should create contacts
   - `edit all contacts` - If VCs should edit contact data (still restricted by ACLs)
   - `add cases` - If VCs should create cases

5. Click **Save**

---

### Step 8.2: Allow Subscribers to Access WordPress Admin for CiviCRM

By default, Subscribers cannot access `/wp-admin/`. Add this code to grant access for CiviCRM pages only.

**Location:** Add to `/wp-content/plugins/maswpcode/maswpcode.php` at the end of the file

```php
/**
 * Allow Subscribers to access CiviCRM admin pages
 */
function mas_allow_subscriber_civicrm_admin_access() {
    $user = wp_get_current_user();

    // Only for subscribers
    if (!in_array('subscriber', (array) $user->roles)) {
        return;
    }

    // Only allow CiviCRM pages
    if (!isset($_GET['page']) || $_GET['page'] !== 'CiviCRM') {
        return;
    }

    // Grant read capability to access admin area
    add_filter('user_has_cap', function($allcaps) {
        $allcaps['read'] = true;
        return $allcaps;
    }, 999);
}
add_action('admin_init', 'mas_allow_subscriber_civicrm_admin_access', 1);
```

**Optional - Hide admin bar for Subscribers:**

```php
/**
 * Hide WordPress admin bar for Subscribers
 */
function mas_hide_admin_bar_for_subscribers() {
    $user = wp_get_current_user();
    if (in_array('subscriber', (array) $user->roles)) {
        show_admin_bar(false);
    }
}
add_action('wp', 'mas_hide_admin_bar_for_subscribers');
```

After adding the code:
1. Save the file
2. Test by logging in as a Subscriber and visiting: `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=CiviCRM`

---

## Part 9: Enable ACLs in CiviCRM

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** This step restricts access globally. Test thoroughly before enabling in production.

1. Go to: **CiviCRM → Administer → Users and Permissions → Permissions (Access Control)**

2. **Check:** "Enable Access Control"

3. Click **Save**

**What happens after enabling:**
- Users without ACL permissions will have restricted access
- Administrators should have proper permissions configured
- Test with admin user first to ensure you still have access

---

## Part 10: Create Navigation Menu Items

Create menu items for VCs to easily access their permitted cases.

### Menu Item 1: Service Requests - Sent for Assignment

1. Go to: **CiviCRM → Administer → Customize Data and Screens → Navigation Menu**

2. Click **Add Menu Item**

3. **Configure:**
   - **Label:** "Service Requests - Sent for Assignment"
   - **URL:** `civicrm/group?reset=1&gid=[GROUP_ID_FROM_PART_1.1]&context=search`
   - **Parent:** Select "Cases" or create a custom parent menu
   - **Permission:** `access CiviCRM`
   - **Operator:** OR
   - **Is Active:** Yes
   - **Separator:** No

4. Click **Save**

**Alternative URL (using existing SearchKit display):**
- If you have SearchKit display ID 125: `civicrm/admin/search#/display/125`

---

### Menu Item 2: My Assigned Cases

1. Click **Add Menu Item**

2. **Configure:**
   - **Label:** "My Assigned Cases"
   - **URL:** `civicrm/group?reset=1&gid=[GROUP_ID_FROM_PART_1.2]&context=search`
   - **Parent:** Select "Cases"
   - **Permission:** `access CiviCRM`
   - **Operator:** OR
   - **Is Active:** Yes
   - **Separator:** No

3. Click **Save**

### Troubleshooting

**Problem:** VC cannot access `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=CiviCRM`
- **Solution:** Verify WordPress admin access code is added (Part 8.2)
- **Solution:** Check WordPress permissions are granted (Part 8.1)

**Problem:** VC sees all contacts (not restricted)
- **Solution:** Verify ACLs are enabled (Part 9)
- **Solution:** Check ACL rules are active: **CiviCRM → Administer → Users and Permissions → Manage ACLs**
- **Solution:** Clear cache: `cv flush` or via UI

**Problem:** VC sees NO contacts
- **Solution:** Verify VC is in "Volunteer Consultants (ACL Group)" (Part 7)
- **Solution:** Check ACL Entity Role assignment exists (Part 4)
- **Solution:** Verify smart groups have members: **CiviCRM → Contacts → Manage Groups**

**Problem:** "My Assigned Cases" shows all cases with Case Coordinators, not just mine
- **Solution:** Verify the smart group name is exactly "Clients_Assigned_to_Current_VC" (Part 1.2)
- **Solution:** Clear cache: `cv flush`
- **Solution:** Check relationship: Ensure Test VC has "Case Coordinator" role on cases
- **Solution:** Check CiviCRM logs for any hook errors: `/path/to/civicrm/ConfigAndLog/`

**Problem:** Permission denied errors
- **Solution:** Check CiviCRM logs: `/path/to/civicrm/ConfigAndLog/`
- **Solution:** Verify WordPress user is properly linked to CiviCRM contact
- **Solution:** Ensure ACL rules have correct group IDs
