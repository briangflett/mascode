- **IMPORTANT**: Update deployment script configurations with production-specific IDs:
  - Case type IDs
  - Message template IDs
  - Location type IDs
  - Custom field group IDs
- Update form redirect URLs for production domain
- Configure SSL certificates for secure form submission
- Test anonymous form access from external networks

cv ext:list | grep mascode

# Check for any extension errors
cv ext:refresh
```

- Verify Project case creation (format: P25XXX)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Installation Issues

**Extension won't enable**
- Check PHP version compatibility (8.3+ recommended)

- Check CiviRules log for rule execution
- Verify trigger conditions are met
- Clear cache with `cv flush`

**Forms not accessible**

**Deployment script errors**
- Verify user has appropriate CiviCRM permissions
- Check that referenced entities exist (case types, etc.)
- Update script configurations for your environment
- Run scripts individually to isolate issues
