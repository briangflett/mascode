## ðŸš€ **How to Get Started**

### **Immediate Next Steps (This Week)**

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/mascode
   composer install
   ```

2. **Run Your First Tests**:
   ```bash
   composer test:unit        # Run unit tests
   composer lint            # Check code style
   composer analyze         # Run static analysis
   composer quality         # Run all quality checks
   ```

3. **Set Up GitHub Repository**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add comprehensive testing and automation framework"
   git push origin main
   ```

### **Learning Tools (Progressive Complexity)**

1. **Start Simple**: 
   - Modify the existing `CodeGeneratorTest.php`
   - Add tests for your actual `CodeGenerator` class
   - Practice the Red-Green-Refactor cycle

2. **Build Complexity**:
   - Create integration tests for your CiviRules actions
   - Test form processing workflows
   - Add performance testing for bulk operations

3. **Advanced Techniques**:
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Test error conditions and edge cases
   - Implement database transaction testing

## ðŸ”§ **Development Workflow**

```bash
# Daily development cycle
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
# Make changes
composer quality                    # Ensure quality
git commit -m "Add new feature"
git push origin feature/new-feature
# Create PR - GitHub Actions will run automatically
```

## ðŸŽ“ **Learning Resources**

### **Testing Mastery**
- Start with the unit tests I created
- Read `docs/TESTING.md` for comprehensive guidance
- Practice TDD with small features first

### **AI Integration**
- Review `docs/AI-ROADMAP.md` for strategic planning
- Start with simple API integrations (OpenAI/Claude)
- Build data pipelines incrementally

### **CiviCRM Extension Development**
- Use the testing framework to validate CiviCRM integrations
