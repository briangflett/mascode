# Contributing to Mascode

## Getting Started

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mascode.git
   cd mascode
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/briangflett/mascode.git
   ```

2. **Development Environment**
   - See [Development Guide](DEVELOPMENT.md) for complete CiviCRM setup
   - Ensure CiviRules extension is installed
   - Test environment should match production versions

3. **Initial Setup**
   ```bash
   # Enable extension in development
   cv ext:enable mascode
   
   # Deploy core components
   cv scr scripts/deploy_self_assessment_surveys.php --user=admin
   cv scr scripts/deploy_civirules.php --user=admin
   cv scr scripts/deploy_rcs_form.php --user=admin
   
   # Clear cache
   cv flush
   ```

### Code Standards

- **PHP Version**: 8.3+ (8.1+ minimum)
- **Coding Style**: [PER Coding Style](https://www.php-fig.org/per/coding-style/) (successor to PSR-12)
- **CiviCRM Patterns**: Use API4, EventDispatcher, modern patterns
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage for all new functionality
- **Documentation**: Update relevant .md files for all changes

### Architecture Guidelines

- **PSR-4 Classes**: Use `Civi/Mascode/` namespace for new classes
- **Event-Driven**: Use EventDispatcher for loose coupling
- **API-First**: CiviCRM API4 for all data operations
- **Service Injection**: Register services via Symfony DI container
- **CiviRules Integration**: Extend `CRM_CivirulesActions_Generic_Api` for actions

## Contribution Workflow

### 1. Create Issue

- Use appropriate [issue template](https://github.com/briangflett/mascode/issues/new/choose)
- **Bug Reports**: Include steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior
- **Feature Requests**: Describe use case, proposed solution, alternatives considered
- Discuss approach for large changes in [Discussions](https://github.com/briangflett/mascode/discussions)

### 2. Development Process

```bash
# Create feature branch from dev
git checkout dev
git pull upstream dev
git checkout -b feature/description

# Make changes following code standards
# Test thoroughly in development environment
# Update documentation as needed

# Run quality checks
cv flush  # Clear cache
# Test deployment scripts if modified
# Verify forms and CiviRules functionality

# Commit with conventional commits
git commit -m "feat: add automatic URL prefixing"
```

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New CiviRules Components

#### New Action
1. Create action class in `Civi/Mascode/CiviRules/Action/`
2. Extend `CRM_CivirulesActions_Generic_Api`
3. Register in `Civi/Mascode/CiviRules/actions.json`
4. Create form in `CRM/Mascode/CiviRules/Form/` (legacy namespace required)
5. Create template in `templates/CRM/Mascode/CiviRules/Form/`
6. Update deployment script to include new action
7. Test action registration and execution

#### New Trigger
1. Create trigger class in `Civi/Mascode/CiviRules/Trigger/`
2. Register in `Civi/Mascode/CiviRules/triggers.json`
3. Update deployment script to include new trigger
4. Test trigger activation and event firing

### Adding New Forms

#### Afform (Recommended)
1. Create form using CiviCRM FormBuilder UI
2. Export form structure and save to deployment script
3. Update deployment script with new form
4. Test form rendering, submission, and data processing
5. Update user documentation

#### Legacy Forms (Avoid)
- Only use if Afform capabilities are insufficient
- Follow existing patterns in `CRM/Mascode/Form/`
- Create corresponding templates

### Adding New Event Subscribers

1. Create in `Civi/Mascode/Event/`
2. Implement `EventSubscriberInterface`
3. Register in container with `event_subscriber` tag
4. Test event subscription and handling

### Documentation Standards

**Code Documentation:**
- PHPDoc blocks for all public methods

- README files for new components

**User Documentation:**
- Update relevant .md files for user-facing changes
- Include screenshots for UI changes
- Provide step-by-step instructions
- Update troubleshooting sections

## Release Process

### Version Numbering
- **Major** (X.0.0): Breaking changes, major feature additions
- **Minor** (X.Y.0): New features, significant enhancements
