# Afform Directory Structure

This directory contains all Afforms (FormBuilder forms and searches) for the MASCode extension.

## Directory Organization

- **`client/`** - Client-facing forms (tag: `Client`)
  - Public forms that clients interact with
  - Examples: RCS Form, Self-Assessment Surveys, Client Feedback

- **`vc/`** - Volunteer Consultant forms and searches (tag: `VC`)
  - Forms and searches used by volunteer consultants
  - Examples: VC Feedback, My Cases, Service Request searches

- **`dashlet/`** - Dashboard widgets (tag: `Dashlet`)
  - SearchKit displays shown on dashboards
  - Examples: Projects by Status, Projects by Year

- **`admin/`** - Administrative forms (tag: `Admin`)
  - Backend administrative tools and forms
  - Future use

- **`block/`** - Reusable form blocks and components
  - Shared fieldsets used across multiple forms
  - Examples: Project fields, Contact fields, Custom group blocks

## Tag Alignment

Directory names match their corresponding CiviCRM tags:
- Directory `client/` → Tag `Client`
- Directory `vc/` → Tag `VC`
- Directory `dashlet/` → Tag `Dashlet`
- Directory `admin/` → Tag `Admin`
- Directory `block/` → No tag (blocks are referenced by name)

## File Naming Convention

All custom forms must be prefixed with `afformMAS` or `afblockMAS`:
- Forms: `afformMAS{FormName}.aff.html` + `.aff.json`
- Blocks: `afblockMAS{BlockName}.aff.html` + `.aff.json`
- Searches: `afsearchMAS{SearchName}.aff.html` + `.aff.json` (optional)

## Deployment

Forms are deployed using `civix export`:
```bash
civix export Afform afformMASFormName
civix export SavedSearch [id]  # Exports search + displays + forms
```

Files generated by `civix export` should be committed to version control for deployment to production.
